Repository for projects utilizing ML in quant strategies.

## Some use cases of ML in trading

(Supervised Learning)
- Signal generation throught prediction, i.e buy or sell signals, based od predicted return or direction
- Risk management through prediction, i.e determining position sizing and stop-loss levels to have more optimized risk.

(Unsupervised Learning)
- Extract insights from the data. For example discover patterns, relationships and structures. 

## Challenges of applying ML in trading

- Very hard to predict returns or prices
- Quite hard to predict return signs
- Hard to predict economic indicator
- Not so hard to predict volatility

Furthermore, some technical challenges are overfitting and generalization, non stationary and regime shifts, as well as interpretation of black models. 

## Workflow Process

1. Collect and prepare data
2. Develop a hypothesis for a strategy
3. Coding the model
4. Backtest the strategy

## What is Unsupervised Learning in trading

Unsupervised learning in trading involves using machine learning techniques to analyze financial data and dicover patterns, relationships and structures within the data without any labeled or predefined target variable. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained to make predictions, unsupervised learning focuses on extracting insights from data.

Here is how unsupervised learning is applied in trading:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
- Market Regime Detection
- Portfolio Optimization

## What is Sentiment Investing

This approuch focuses on analyzing how people feel about cetaing stocks, industries or the overall market.
Is assumes that public sentiment can impact stock prices and markets. For example, if many people are positive about particular company on Twitter, it might indicate portntial for that company's stock to perform well.
